## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Hide Generation Display
The person detail page SHALL NOT display the "辈分" (generation) field, as showing "第零代" is confusing to end users.

#### Scenario: Generation row not visible
- **WHEN** the user views a person's detail page
- **THEN** no "辈分" row is shown in the basic information section
